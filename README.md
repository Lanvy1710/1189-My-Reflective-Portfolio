# 41189-My-Reflective-Portfolio
## Week 1
### What have I learnt this week?
Introduction to Human-centred Complex System’s lecture this week was presented and described about the definition, key attributes of a system and complex systems. Firstly, to start with the lesson, the discussion about the key attributes which is about elements of each system, the connection of elements with systems or function. Furthermore, we had a small conversation about system boundaries which came up with many ideas and thoughts from students and professors. Secondly, the professor explained about the different ways system are characterised such as open system, closed system and isolated system. The value of each system which were conversed together about features and how it works by students. Moreover, describing about some common characteristics of systems like structure, behaviour, functional, a system is a whole that can not be separated. Thirdly, I carefully considered about the description of what makes a system complex. The professor explicated the different between complex and complicated, and presented complex systems exposing emergence, self-organization. Finally, knowing well about the different level of complexity, complex adaptive systems and some examples of social systems.       
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
After week 1 lesson, one of the new points is about boundaries system which are the isolated system and how it works. Before, I just knew about two characterised which are the open and closed system. Isolated system description was coming up with an interested point that it does not allow to transfer of neither mass or power between it or surroundings. Moreover, I understand carefully about the complex system and how it evolves into a different level. 
### What insights have I gained?
I deeply achieved about emergent behaviour which was about comprehending the system with many elements and structure. Furthermore, I have recognized human body as the highest complex system which our body can transfer energy, metabolism, behaviour, functional as well as structural relationships between each other such as our brain has nerves connect to each other to control other part of the body. 
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
*Perceived strengths*
-	Understanding well about the description of systems.
-	Can fix the problem based on feedback.
-	Opportunities to develop thinking.

*Perceived weaknesses*
-	Lack of information.
-	Limited experience about system.
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Upon reflection, it was observed that one of the situations that I have met which was the presentation and we needed to separate into different role for each member and to set a goal for us to acchieve the highest score. One of the members did not come to discuss about the assessment and roles. So, my team and I divided into each session. It was really hard for us to work on since we lacked one member. To face with this challenge, we defined and discussed together about our position and used brainstorming to analyse all the information.  
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
With a great deal of knowledge already gained, I would consider working based on the social system which would be more connective and easier to outline position, goal, objectives and norms to work in a team. I believe the teamwork would be effective and achieve higher score since we need to be organised all parts and sentiments of each members.  
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
I considered the social system will be useful to apply in the real life since I have gained a huge knowledge and some examples to use it to face with unexpected situations. For example, social system would be covered overall unity for people when they discuss their ideas and specific theoretical points. During the lesson, the professor has shown and discussed about the social and technical system with a basic example which help me learn about how can it work organised for daily life. 
## Week 2.
### What have I learnt this week?
Introduction to Human-centred Complex System’s lecture this week was presented and described about the description of a model, science of many models and the reason why we should make a model to solve problem and wisdom hierachy. Firstly, to understand clearly about what is a model, so an activity was created by drawing about our self and I really enjoyed this one. Knowing about mental model which can lead to multiple thoughts from numerous people and discussed by observing the iceberg. The value of models which were created to make people think clearer, employ the statistic, and generate ideas by designing and allow people to choose a better decision. Embodiment, analogy approach and alternative reality are three types of model which based on designing, exploring, acting, and communicating … Moreover, I gained knowledge about the typically modelling workflow and deliberated on those complex systems and wicked problems. Secondly, I carefully considered the wisdom of crowds which was presented with the antiquity of submarine. Once seemed obviously that the conclusion based on the process of four 4 conditions now it is more tempting to deeply think and learn about the traditional process which decision maker has the connection between stakeholders and consultants. In conclusion, to apply many models such as mathematics model (diversity prediction theorem) in real life and talked about the limit of multiple models. 
### What do I “know how” that I did not before? 
In reflecting upon the tutorial exercise, it was useful to learn more clearly about the relationship between models and our brain. One of the new points is the condition of good model based on the excellence realism with two characteristics which are parameter and model complexity. Knowing that many conversations of numerous people came from multiple different degrees and diversified thoughts. Learned and discussed about the wisdom hierachy that helped me communicate better and correct higher probability for solving problems.      
### What insights have I gained?
Understanding clearly about models and its process, the difference of each one forced me to reflect on the aims of the lesson which can gain many benefits from using models and usually apply it for daily life. After the class, I can do better in analyzing information by using model, focusing thinking with opportunity to solve my own problems, gain more flexible involvement with my team, relationships, and co-workers. Furthermore, creating models which make me improve the faculty of reviewing or presenting in group work or assessments.  
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
*The perceived strengths:*
- Opportunity to apply multiple ideas.
- Knowing well about the value of each model.
- Explaining and discussing well based on model.
- Easy to communicate with other people.

*The perceived weaknesses:*
- Lack of experiences. 
- Limited decision creation.
- No design talent.
- Bad at paying attention.
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
There was a situation at one of my group assessments which was calculating to design a mathematics model. Our figures were not matched, and it is complicated to organize since three of us worked on different models. We wasted plenty of time to draw and fix it. To face with this challenge, my team and I decided to design simulation on the computer and communicate with each other. After that, we spent almost the time to estimate the model together and we were successful in our assignment. 
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Before doing my assessments, I would try to visualize what need to do and analyze multiple information in a model. So that I can easy to discuss and explain in a conversation or presentation. It would help me to save time, deeply understand and gain knowledge. Studying by using model would support us to be more creative and attract other people in our own work.  
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
My position as a student deeply studied about the science of many models, I believe that “Diversity Prediction Theorem” can be helpful if we apply to use it in real life. For example, diversity prediction theorem is a draft of programming task which can quality control and build the opportunity of coding, learning, and increasing thinking ability. I have learnt from a basic example and it was really interested since it showed equation of the failure of the crowd and how it worked.

## Week 3
### What have I learnt this week?
Introduction to Human-centred Complex System’s lecture this week was presented and covered about modelling how people behave, decide, add value, and power. At the beginning of the lesson, the professor lectured on the description of rational, behavioural (irrational) and rule-based model which can help human to make better decisions in their situation. Then, a small conversation between the professor and students deliberate about the use and benefits of each model which can support people in life-changing decisions. Next, discussed the multi creation problem which associates with the judgment from characteristic and comparison. decision trees model was valued in facilities way to apply it in real life. During the presentation, the professor came up with many examples including the calculation of each predictive decision in the decision trees. Thirdly, we gained more knowledge about the signalling model and knowing discrete symbol recognition of the replica to apply an alternative explanation. Finally, studying the definition of models of value and power including some interesting examples to show the operation of the model when it was used in real life and discuss how people work to solve in a group.          
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
To reflect upon the learning in this week, I comprehend more deeply about the model of rational decision making which could be perfect for people to change their decision. This model is based on realistic and represents people’s behaviours in any situation. In addition, the rationality model usually goes with the heuristic factor and it brings the opportunity to maximize the outcome for the business when they apply it in their occupation. For example, people need to identify their target before they want to buy something and value each solution. Then, we choose the best decision and implement which will bring the best result for us.            
### What insights have I gained?
I deeply understood the definition of each model and how we choose the best possible option. We can use these models in our daily life which affect human’s behaviour, nerves, action, and the creation of implementation details individually without biases of each model. Moreover, knowing more about the rules of thumb which based on practical experience more than theoretical to complete and approach a certain goal for people. During the lesson, I have learnt many definitions about the perspective of innovation when people worked in a group.     
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
*Perceived strengths:*
- Extremely focus on the implementation details of models.
- Understand the structure of each model.
- Ability to value the probability of models in solving a problem.

*Perceived weaknesses:*
- Limited using models when making decisions.
- Not really effective to solve some situation.
- Lack of diversity.
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
The situation that I have encountered that I learned to take a motorcycle driver’s license test. It was hard for me since I had to remember how to obey the basic traffic rule to drive a vehicle. The course includes numerous signals, directions, and theorists. To achieve my license, I tried to make a plan, manage time to work hard by reading the theory of traffic rule and doing many trial tests on the internet.
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
After the lesson in week 3, I have learnt about the signalling model which is interested to apply in studying. I will create a model that combines the theory and signs so I can decrease timing and acquire knowledge quicker. Additionally, using the signalling model will make me feel more interested in learning and encourage me to finish my goal most ultimately since it uses to determine information in an effective way.
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
These models are always used directly to support people in their real life. I believe the decision trees can be the most useful since it has an impact on the final result and minimizes hazard with their decision. Because I have used this model before when I studied the online course about business management skills. Then, I created decision trees and separate into four options which led to the best solution in business occupation. Decision trees model includes the calculation of the probability of each choice and shows the percentage of success based on the logistic for our work.
## Week 4
### What have I learnt this week?
Introduction to Human-centred Complex System's lecture this week was presented and introduced the implementation features individual of each system, which are system dynamics models, network models, and agent-based models. Firstly, the professor covered the world, which always has feedback, interdependence, and postponed in timing. Then, the explanation was about the systems dynamic model that came up with many features such as stocks, sources, flows, or sinks. To understand more clearly how the systems dynamic work that the professor taught about the structure of this system. Besides, this system's construction is the source of essential and has the common with system behaviour. Furthermore, knowing about many kinds of models that came up in the lesson such as what - if experiment stocks and flows, runaway loops. Secondly, learning about the network's description is about the structure, logic, and functionality of the network models. It was interesting to gain how to calculate the form and the connection of each node. In addition, there was conservation about the relationship of the weak ties, which is an example of the pandemic (COVID-19) and the strong ties. In conclusion, I deeply understood in the agent-based model, which associates with the real situation we are facing. The ABM is linked with complex systems, and it has multiple points of view, upgrading adaptive processes. One interesting example was provided in a lesson that was breaking the rules since it was presented about emergent things we learned and targeted. Then I totally learned about modelling with stakeholders and focusing on the inform determination. The professor showed some basic examples of the virus on the network and demonstrated seven scenarios of the COVID-19.   
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
In reflecting upon the tutorial exercise, it was advantageous to know about the agent-based model that connects with complex systems, including agents, environment, rules, and social structure. The real situation which we are facing with a pandemic is COVID-19, and the agent-based model interacts autonomous agent to show the accession of the impact on the system. For example, the agent-based model can evaluate numerous details to view both the infection spread and recovery of each diseased individual of the COVID-19 pandemic. While using the agent-based model, each node's state can be upgraded independently, and people can probably follow the process change day by day.  
### What insights have I gained?
A significant insight I have learned about how people can keep track of the situation with three models and the structure to value the detail based on the system. Learning about the network model that connects numerous independent groups can measure multiple forms to emulate objects in the real situation. During the lesson, it also explained how the model could be created with weak and strong ties. Moreover, knowing more clearly about the dynamic system's structures contain the behaviours and conditions released to it.
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
*Perceived strengths:*
- Have the ability to gain and information processing.
- Learning from the basic example and develop it to solve the situation.
- Can relate the knowledge in the course with the past experience.  

*Perceived weaknesses:*
- Got confusion while learning about the dynamic model with some examples.
- Procrastination while doing the model.
- Have no experience with the NetLogo and Python.
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
I was using my notebook to take notes and write the necessary detail about the lesson, and I was confused with Python since I have no past experience working on it. I was researching more information about the Python language with some basic programming to understand how it works and knows about the code with some different examples that have been provided during the course.
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
To reflect upon the learning process this week, I would consider learning to approach Python and use it as the most successful during this course. Understanding the necessary code through to Python will help me retain more knowledge to practice better and work accomplishment in this semester.
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
I think the agent-based model was one of the most interested models and useful for us to apply it in reality. As I mentioned, it helped identify and demonstrate the COVID-19 for people to follow and receive the pandemic situation. Moreover, The agent-based model works on one to one and relates to the realities situation and keeps track of the agent's changes and development, target and adaptive processes.
## Week 5
### What have I learnt this week?
Introduction to Human-centred Complex System's lecture this week was presented and explained about aggregating decisions and behaviours and distribution levels such as standard and long-tail type. Focusing on how the probability distributions can help create our world and the main characteristics of agents contributing to systems. Then, understanding the standard distribution description, and it depends on the mean and standard deviation to measure the mode. Hence, I have known that the logic of models based on its hypothesis, distribution, possibility, and personal development level, which are attractive to gain and apply in reality. Finally, I enormously gain about the long-tailed distribution that occurs because of feedbacks and interdependencies, and it links with power laws.
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
In this week five lecture, much interesting content has been provided, and self-organised criticality is a new theorem I have learnt this week. Some basic examples were given, such as sand grains' addition to present the process that builds each characteristic's independencies until the systems achieved the critical state and breaks the balance in the system. Self-organised criticality is based on people's behaviour, which combines with other factors to create model structures. The forest fire is a pictogram example to clearly understand the critical action, behaviours of people and this theory through the professor's teaching.
### What insights have I gained?
The theory that overwhelmed me the most was the content of power laws that have come from the TED Talk of Geoff West regarding the existence of the cities and corporations. Maintaining these two factors' lifetimes requires the creation, motivation, and endless modification leading to the effect of its growth. Through this video, I have learnt that cities always grow in numerous ways across many stages leading to many negative consequences similar to positive sides. Moreover, a lack of abundance problems and attraction of talent leading to innovation has always prevented companies' development. Besides, companies are usually gathered for a certain amount of time to develop in a definite direction and quickly lose people's interest. Geoff explained the significant point about how cities can long-term survival since it depends on continually evolving people and creating new ideas. Consequently, I would be able to prepare and gain more experience in various jobs instead of stuck in one position to contribute to the change in cities' lifetimes.
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
*Perceived strengths*
- Identify and determine models while discussing for group assessment and find an appropriate topic.
- Understanding well about theorems provided in the lesson and think further on other examples to apply in reality.
- Receiving some feedbacks while having a conversation with my team to calculate the probability of success on the selected topic.  

*Perceived weaknesses*
- Lack of experience with some models since I have not learnt about that before.
- Got some misunderstandings about the application of the six sigma thinking model.
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
My team and I had a conversation about separating works for each member to finish our group assessment. Our discussion was excellent since everyone focused on giving their opinions and figuring out how the disrepair systems were based on researching the information. It is a bit difficult for me since I have no past experience in political models and work on Python. However, my team and I are working hard and study the Python language for this group assessment to gain high overall marks.
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
After our group discussion, we have mentioned some factors and situations for the main topic as well as talked about Jupyter. Although we do not have many experiences of using Jupyter lab, we are attempting to understand the primary coding language. We need to focus on the issues that revolve around our topic and how we can solve it. Moreover, I will try to accomplish faster in our group work and also boldly express my ideas while deliberating to gain higher quality in the next meeting.
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
To reflect upon the learning process this week workshop, I have observed that the mighty central limit theorem will be useful to apply in reality. I can make numerous options which concern to each other and calculate selections made through the probability distribution. An example I have been thinking of this theorem is using in measuring numbers of customers to will not be interested in some of my products for my business plan. Anticipating the situation as well as determining which parts of my manufactured will make the income decrease.  
## Week 6
### What have I learnt this week?
Introduction to Human-centred Complex System's lecture this week was presented and explained about the complex system's timing improve based on six new models which are the Markov model, the random walks, broadcast model, diffusion model, bass model, and contagion. Firstly, the Markov model's explanation came up with many compelling examples and is based on the theorem to apply it in reality and upgrade the determination system that supports the business. Secondly, a small conversation of random walks model with an example of the drunk man will fall off or not help me understand the calculation and solve it. This model can support me while using it to make decisions in the investment. Finally, I have learned that the bass model combines from the broadcast and diffusion along with theorems.  Besides, the contagion SIR model was designed for people to follow the spread of the COVID-19 and can be able to apply to media phenomena that are strongly disseminated in society.
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
In reflecting upon the tutorial exercise, I have approached and learned many concepts about six models, but the Markov convergence theorem makes me pay the most attention. This theorem towards an equilibrium distribution that is a unique state and fixes transition probabilities during the process. This calculation's unique feature is that it always has the transition between any two states, and it could take a long time to reach the equilibrium. The Markov model can apply in business since it is not a simple circle that makes the exchange with many stages. For example, making a model describes the impacts of probabilities and transition between profits, bad loans, investment, and risky money to understand the company's working process.
### What insights have I gained?
A significant insight I have learned about the contagion SIR model, which describes the spread of the COVID-19 by a diagram providing necessary information. It was modelling the pandemic's assumption, which moves from the essential reproduction of the calculation about the infected and recovered cases to the result and clearly shows in the graph. This model has many similarities with the agent-based model that we enormously studied in week 4. Besides, I have thought about other examples based on this model about the diffusion of virtually social phenomena and things that many people are most concerned with, such as diet plans or workout. For instance, we can create a diet plan model that emulates overall people following each content and measure the percentage by curves.
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
*Perceived strengths:*
- Gaining the process based on examples that provide during the lesson.                         
- Having a conversation with my team member to identify which part for each individual to work on it. 
- Using the knowledge of the six models which relate and may support our group assessment topic.

*Perceived weaknesses:*
- Still limited about the Jupyter's language and experience to work on it.
- Misunderstood and got confused with the bass model for the first time.
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
After this week's lesson, my team and I ultimately decided the part for our members need to describe, and we also created the draft document to finish it. We also figure out the python coding and outline all general ideas to complete the content in our group work for the submission in week 8. However, the only problem we face is working on the Jupyter since we just know a little bit about the structure and how it works.
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
To reflect upon the working process this week, the improvement things that I could do next time I will be more profoundly understanding the python language and finish the basic coding to collaborate with my team members better. Then, I will focus on our topic's main idea and discuss more in-depth in models that apply in our case. I also want to make some announcements for our schedule since it will be more effective while working in our assessment.
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
After learning this week's lecture, I consider that the most relevant theory in this module was the Granovetter Threshold. I was surprised by how this theory works since it describes the spread and interaction between people making independent choices. We can apply this theorem to value analysis profits based on customers in the market for businesses can be able to create the trend and promote selling products such as the fashion aspect.
## Week 7
### What have I learnt this week?
Introduction to Human-centred Complex System's lecture this week was presented and described three types of emergent behaviours that helped me understand those lessons more deeply in previous weeks. Firstly, the conversation about social contagion is Schelling's segregation model, Granovetter's riot model, and the Standing ovation model that describes the spread of information and people's behaviours. Secondly, we discussed the different cultures combines with pure coordination and enormously gained by following multiple interesting coordination games. Finally, we deliberated how to apply these models in reality and make a better decision while facing the situation by calculating based on the theorem. After this week's lecture, I have thought further with three new models that relate and support our group assessment ideas.
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Upon reflection, it was observed that Schelling's segregation model relates to the agent-based model, which we have learnt in week 4. This concept is significant since it describes the segregation based on factors of agents and their behaviours. The professor provided an interesting example of the regional and colour skin differentiation during the lecture that helped me acquire and determine this model's operation. Moreover, this heuristic simulated such as a checkerboard, illustrates the movement of agents and then provides a final statistic with the percentage. 
### What insights have I gained?
A significant insight I have learned about Granovetter's riot model and the standing ovation that can be applied to solve real-life problems. Knowing that this model describes when individuals have to make their own choice, and it also spreads influence on other people to make the same decision. Furthermore, I have examined this model to deeply understand the crowd effect in social situations and how it works in events such as presidential elections, protests, and propaganda. Besides, I have also taken some notes to develop my ideas related to our group topic since it can be used to measure people's behaviours and create movements in our model.
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
*Perceived strengths:*
- Understanding and be able to link the model with other stuff in previous weeks.
- Discussed with our group and also finished our group submission for week 8.
- Examined and thought about the content that we did to apply it more successfully in solving the issues.

*Perceived weaknesses:*
- Struggled for the first time while doing the group assignment and also misunderstood the content of our topic.
- Got confusion while discussing and applying the theory to solve the situation.
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Upon reflection, I observed the situations that I was working on the model and describing ideas with my team. After this week's lecture, my team and I had a conversation about applying three models to solve our issues and deliberate further in the next concept to work on it. For the first time, I struggled while giving the solutions with the statistic of a model, and it wasted plenty of time to figure out and led to the wrong way. I tried to finish it by myself and got more confusion since it was not relevant to our group topic. However, I decided to discuss my problem with my team, and after I finished my part, they gave me some feedback to proofread and edit my section to gain a better result.
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
To reflect upon the working process this week, the improvement things that I consider working with my team more to receive more feedback and finish my section more effectively. Moreover, I should ask my team about my problems in learning the model's materials and contact the tutor to request more examples with my content. Following strictly with our group concept by reading the script more carefully and applying existing knowledge to think further in the topic.  
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
After learning this week's lecture, I believed that I could apply the pure coordination games in social learning. The game theory is quite interesting to follow, and it gave me a new perspective on understanding the different cultures and the influence of other people in society. We also can simulate problems via an exciting game to discuss and figure out solutions. Furthermore, I can create a model with the Netlogo with the code provided from the website to use in our situation.
