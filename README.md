# 41189-My-Reflective-Portfolio
## Week 1
### What have I learnt this week?
Introduction to Human-centred Complex System’s lecture this week was presented and described about the definition, key attributes of a system and complex systems. Firstly, to start with the lesson, the discussion about the key attributes which is about elements of each system, the connection of elements with systems or function. Furthermore, we had a small conversation about system boundaries which came up with many ideas and thoughts from students and professors. Secondly, the professor explained about the different ways system are characterised such as open system, closed system and isolated system. The value of each system which were conversed together about features and how it works by students. Moreover, describing about some common characteristics of systems like structure, behaviour, functional, a system is a whole that can not be separated. Thirdly, I carefully considered about the description of what makes a system complex. The professor explicated the different between complex and complicated, and presented complex systems exposing emergence, self-organization. Finally, knowing well about the different level of complexity, complex adaptive systems and some examples of social systems.       
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
After week 1 lesson, one of the new points is about boundaries system which are the isolated system and how it works. Before, I just knew about two characterised which are the open and closed system. Isolated system description was coming up with an interested point that it does not allow to transfer of neither mass or power between it or surroundings. Moreover, I understand carefully about the complex system and how it evolves into a different level. 
### What insights have I gained?
I deeply achieved about emergent behaviour which was about comprehending the system with many elements and structure. Furthermore, I have recognized human body as the highest complex system which our body can transfer energy, metabolism, behaviour, functional as well as structural relationships between each other such as our brain has nerves connect to each other to control other part of the body. 
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
*Perceived strengths*
-	Understanding well about the description of systems.
-	Can fix the problem based on feedback.
-	Opportunities to develop thinking.

*Perceived weaknesses*
-	Lack of information.
-	Limited experience about system.
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Upon reflection, it was observed that one of the situations that I have met which was the presentation and we needed to separate into different role for each member and to set a goal for us to acchieve the highest score. One of the members did not come to discuss about the assessment and roles. So, my team and I divided into each session. It was really hard for us to work on since we lacked one member. To face with this challenge, we defined and discussed together about our position and used brainstorming to analyse all the information.  
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
With a great deal of knowledge already gained, I would consider working based on the social system which would be more connective and easier to outline position, goal, objectives and norms to work in a team. I believe the teamwork would be effective and achieve higher score since we need to be organised all parts and sentiments of each members.  
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
I considered the social system will be useful to apply in the real life since I have gained a huge knowledge and some examples to use it to face with unexpected situations. For example, social system would be covered overall unity for people when they discuss their ideas and specific theoretical points. During the lesson, the professor has shown and discussed about the social and technical system with a basic example which help me learn about how can it work organised for daily life. 
## Week 2.
### What have I learnt this week?
Introduction to Human-centred Complex System’s lecture this week was presented and described about the description of a model, science of many models and the reason why we should make a model to solve problem and wisdom hierachy. Firstly, to understand clearly about what is a model, so an activity was created by drawing about our self and I really enjoyed this one. Knowing about mental model which can lead to multiple thoughts from numerous people and discussed by observing the iceberg. The value of models which were created to make people think clearer, employ the statistic, and generate ideas by designing and allow people to choose a better decision. Embodiment, analogy approach and alternative reality are three types of model which based on designing, exploring, acting, and communicating … Moreover, I gained knowledge about the typically modelling workflow and deliberated on those complex systems and wicked problems. Secondly, I carefully considered the wisdom of crowds which was presented with the antiquity of submarine. Once seemed obviously that the conclusion based on the process of four 4 conditions now it is more tempting to deeply think and learn about the traditional process which decision maker has the connection between stakeholders and consultants. In conclusion, to apply many models such as mathematics model (diversity prediction theorem) in real life and talked about the limit of multiple models. 
### What do I “know how” that I did not before? 
In reflecting upon the tutorial exercise, it was useful to learn more clearly about the relationship between models and our brain. One of the new points is the condition of good model based on the excellence realism with two characteristics which are parameter and model complexity. Knowing that many conversations of numerous people came from multiple different degrees and diversified thoughts. Learned and discussed about the wisdom hierachy that helped me communicate better and correct higher probability for solving problems.      
### What insights have I gained?
Understanding clearly about models and its process, the difference of each one forced me to reflect on the aims of the lesson which can gain many benefits from using models and usually apply it for daily life. After the class, I can do better in analyzing information by using model, focusing thinking with opportunity to solve my own problems, gain more flexible involvement with my team, relationships, and co-workers. Furthermore, creating models which make me improve the faculty of reviewing or presenting in group work or assessments.  
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
*The perceived strengths:*
- Opportunity to apply multiple ideas.
- Knowing well about the value of each model.
- Explaining and discussing well based on model.
- Easy to communicate with other people.

*The perceived weaknesses:*
- Lack of experiences. 
- Limited decision creation.
- No design talent.
- Bad at paying attention.
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
There was a situation at one of my group assessments which was calculating to design a mathematics model. Our figures were not matched, and it is complicated to organize since three of us worked on different models. We wasted plenty of time to draw and fix it. To face with this challenge, my team and I decided to design simulation on the computer and communicate with each other. After that, we spent almost the time to estimate the model together and we were successful in our assignment. 
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Before doing my assessments, I would try to visualize what need to do and analyze multiple information in a model. So that I can easy to discuss and explain in a conversation or presentation. It would help me to save time, deeply understand and gain knowledge. Studying by using model would support us to be more creative and attract other people in our own work.  
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
My position as a student deeply studied about the science of many models, I believe that “Diversity Prediction Theorem” can be helpful if we apply to use it in real life. For example, diversity prediction theorem is a draft of programming task which can quality control and build the opportunity of coding, learning, and increasing thinking ability. I have learnt from a basic example and it was really interested since it showed equation of the failure of the crowd and how it worked.
