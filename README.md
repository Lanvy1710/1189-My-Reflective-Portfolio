# 41189-My-Reflective-Portfolio
## Week 1
### What have I learnt this week?
Introduction to Human-centred Complex System’s lecture this week was presented and described about the definition, key attributes of a system and complex systems. Firstly, to start with the lesson, the discussion about the key attributes which is about elements of each system, the connection of elements with systems or function. Furthermore, we had a small conversation about system boundaries which came up with many ideas and thoughts from students and professors. Secondly, the professor explained about the different ways system are characterised such as open system, closed system and isolated system. The value of each system which were conversed together about features and how it works by students. Moreover, describing about some common characteristics of systems like structure, behaviour, functional, a system is a whole that can not be separated. Thirdly, I carefully considered about the description of what makes a system complex. The professor explicated the different between complex and complicated, and presented complex systems exposing emergence, self-organization. Finally, knowing well about the different level of complexity, complex adaptive systems and some examples of social systems.       
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
After week 1 lesson, one of the new points is about boundaries system which are the isolated system and how it works. Before, I just knew about two characterised which are the open and closed system. Isolated system description was coming up with an interested point that it does not allow to transfer of neither mass or power between it or surroundings. Moreover, I understand carefully about the complex system and how it evolves into a different level. 
### What insights have I gained?
I deeply achieved about emergent behaviour which was about comprehending the system with many elements and structure. Furthermore, I have recognized human body as the highest complex system which our body can transfer energy, metabolism, behaviour, functional as well as structural relationships between each other such as our brain has nerves connect to each other to control other part of the body. 
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
*Perceived strengths*
-	Understanding well about the description of systems.
-	Can fix the problem based on feedback.
-	Opportunities to develop thinking.

*Perceived weaknesses*
-	Lack of information.
-	Limited experience about system.
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Upon reflection, it was observed that one of the situations that I have met which was the presentation and we needed to separate into different role for each member and to set a goal for us to acchieve the highest score. One of the members did not come to discuss about the assessment and roles. So, my team and I divided into each session. It was really hard for us to work on since we lacked one member. To face with this challenge, we defined and discussed together about our position and used brainstorming to analyse all the information.  
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
With a great deal of knowledge already gained, I would consider working based on the social system which would be more connective and easier to outline position, goal, objectives and norms to work in a team. I believe the teamwork would be effective and achieve higher score since we need to be organised all parts and sentiments of each members.  
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
I considered the social system will be useful to apply in the real life since I have gained a huge knowledge and some examples to use it to face with unexpected situations. For example, social system would be covered overall unity for people when they discuss their ideas and specific theoretical points. During the lesson, the professor has shown and discussed about the social and technical system with a basic example which help me learn about how can it work organised for daily life. 
## Week 2.
### What have I learnt this week?
Introduction to Human-centred Complex System’s lecture this week was presented and described about the description of a model, science of many models and the reason why we should make a model to solve problem and wisdom hierachy. Firstly, to understand clearly about what is a model, so an activity was created by drawing about our self and I really enjoyed this one. Knowing about mental model which can lead to multiple thoughts from numerous people and discussed by observing the iceberg. The value of models which were created to make people think clearer, employ the statistic, and generate ideas by designing and allow people to choose a better decision. Embodiment, analogy approach and alternative reality are three types of model which based on designing, exploring, acting, and communicating … Moreover, I gained knowledge about the typically modelling workflow and deliberated on those complex systems and wicked problems. Secondly, I carefully considered the wisdom of crowds which was presented with the antiquity of submarine. Once seemed obviously that the conclusion based on the process of four 4 conditions now it is more tempting to deeply think and learn about the traditional process which decision maker has the connection between stakeholders and consultants. In conclusion, to apply many models such as mathematics model (diversity prediction theorem) in real life and talked about the limit of multiple models. 
### What do I “know how” that I did not before? 
In reflecting upon the tutorial exercise, it was useful to learn more clearly about the relationship between models and our brain. One of the new points is the condition of good model based on the excellence realism with two characteristics which are parameter and model complexity. Knowing that many conversations of numerous people came from multiple different degrees and diversified thoughts. Learned and discussed about the wisdom hierachy that helped me communicate better and correct higher probability for solving problems.      
### What insights have I gained?
Understanding clearly about models and its process, the difference of each one forced me to reflect on the aims of the lesson which can gain many benefits from using models and usually apply it for daily life. After the class, I can do better in analyzing information by using model, focusing thinking with opportunity to solve my own problems, gain more flexible involvement with my team, relationships, and co-workers. Furthermore, creating models which make me improve the faculty of reviewing or presenting in group work or assessments.  
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
*The perceived strengths:*
- Opportunity to apply multiple ideas.
- Knowing well about the value of each model.
- Explaining and discussing well based on model.
- Easy to communicate with other people.

*The perceived weaknesses:*
- Lack of experiences. 
- Limited decision creation.
- No design talent.
- Bad at paying attention.
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
There was a situation at one of my group assessments which was calculating to design a mathematics model. Our figures were not matched, and it is complicated to organize since three of us worked on different models. We wasted plenty of time to draw and fix it. To face with this challenge, my team and I decided to design simulation on the computer and communicate with each other. After that, we spent almost the time to estimate the model together and we were successful in our assignment. 
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Before doing my assessments, I would try to visualize what need to do and analyze multiple information in a model. So that I can easy to discuss and explain in a conversation or presentation. It would help me to save time, deeply understand and gain knowledge. Studying by using model would support us to be more creative and attract other people in our own work.  
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
My position as a student deeply studied about the science of many models, I believe that “Diversity Prediction Theorem” can be helpful if we apply to use it in real life. For example, diversity prediction theorem is a draft of programming task which can quality control and build the opportunity of coding, learning, and increasing thinking ability. I have learnt from a basic example and it was really interested since it showed equation of the failure of the crowd and how it worked.

## Week 3
### What have I learnt this week?
Introduction to Human-centred Complex System’s lecture this week was presented and covered about modelling how people behave, decide, add value, and power. At the beginning of the lesson, the professor lectured on the description of rational, behavioural (irrational) and rule-based model which can help human to make better decisions in their situation. Then, a small conversation between the professor and students deliberate about the use and benefits of each model which can support people in life-changing decisions. Next, discussed the multi creation problem which associates with the judgment from characteristic and comparison. decision trees model was valued in facilities way to apply it in real life. During the presentation, the professor came up with many examples including the calculation of each predictive decision in the decision trees. Thirdly, we gained more knowledge about the signalling model and knowing discrete symbol recognition of the replica to apply an alternative explanation. Finally, studying the definition of models of value and power including some interesting examples to show the operation of the model when it was used in real life and discuss how people work to solve in a group.          
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
To reflect upon the learning in this week, I comprehend more deeply about the model of rational decision making which could be perfect for people to change their decision. This model is based on realistic and represents people’s behaviours in any situation. In addition, the rationality model usually goes with the heuristic factor and it brings the opportunity to maximize the outcome for the business when they apply it in their occupation. For example, people need to identify their target before they want to buy something and value each solution. Then, we choose the best decision and implement which will bring the best result for us.            
### What insights have I gained?
I deeply understood the definition of each model and how we choose the best possible option. We can use these models in our daily life which affect human’s behaviour, nerves, action, and the creation of implementation details individually without biases of each model. Moreover, knowing more about the rules of thumb which based on practical experience more than theoretical to complete and approach a certain goal for people. During the lesson, I have learnt many definitions about the perspective of innovation when people worked in a group.     
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
*Perceived strengths:*
- Extremely focus on the implementation details of models.
- Understand the structure of each model.
- Ability to value the probability of models in solving a problem.

*Perceived weaknesses:*
- Limited using models when making decisions.
- Not really effective to solve some situation.
- Lack of diversity.
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
The situation that I have encountered that I learned to take a motorcycle driver’s license test. It was hard for me since I had to remember how to obey the basic traffic rule to drive a vehicle. The course includes numerous signals, directions, and theorists. To achieve my license, I tried to make a plan, manage time to work hard by reading the theory of traffic rule and doing many trial tests on the internet.
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
After the lesson in week 3, I have learnt about the signalling model which is interested to apply in studying. I will create a model that combines the theory and signs so I can decrease timing and acquire knowledge quicker. Additionally, using the signalling model will make me feel more interested in learning and encourage me to finish my goal most ultimately since it uses to determine information in an effective way.
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
These models are always used directly to support people in their real life. I believe the decision trees can be the most useful since it has an impact on the final result and minimizes hazard with their decision. Because I have used this model before when I studied the online course about business management skills. Then, I created decision trees and separate into four options which led to the best solution in business occupation. Decision trees model includes the calculation of the probability of each choice and shows the percentage of success based on the logistic for our work.
